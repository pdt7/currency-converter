This project was developed to JayaÂ´s challenge: create a currency converter using an external API to retrieve the exchange rate.

to run this application use the command: npm start and to test: npm test

To build the API rest the technology used is node.js, 2 folders was created:
    1 - models - to describe the informations to transaction
    2 - routes - to define the routes off aplicattion

create de file index.js to initialize the app and connect to the no-relational BD (MongoDB).

the file .env is important to set DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD, because the developer is different to production, and this step configure this.
